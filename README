Sample from JFokus 2012 Talk on One-liners.

This sample exhibits a little map reduce algorithm by querying a very simple Coupon-like REST Service.
Slides at http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus12/jf12_One-linersAreYourFriend-IncreasingScalabilityWithScala.pdf


Server side:
- Unfiltered toolkit for REST api

Client side:
- Dispatch REST client.

Test:
- Specs BDD style

Build:
- sbt version 0.11.2


To Run the server:
> sbt
> update
> run    (choose Local Server)

This will start a small coupon service mockup on port 8086, accessible at http://localhost:8086/deals

On another window:
> sbt
> console
> ... run the code from  https://gist.github.com/1838722 or from the slides

To run the tests:
> sbt
> test
